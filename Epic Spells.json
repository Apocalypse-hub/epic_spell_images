				"With a snap of your fingers, you invoke the most powerful magic ever produced in the known multiverse.",
				"You change reality to a new mode of existence, with near-limitless potential. In the known history of this spell, no casting has failed to produce the desired effect exactly as intended. A “typical” casting of this spell involves replicating the effects of any other Epic spell as Deific effects. An “atypical” casting must involve a desire that can be stated in twelve words or less. However, when you cast this spell in an “atypical” manner, roll a {@dice d20}. On a roll of 19 or lower the spell fails, you take arcane damage equal to your hit point maximum, and you cannot cast the spell again until 1 year has passed. On a roll of 20 the spell functions normally, but you can never cast it again. Even the power of this spell cannot circumvent this effect.",
				"{@bold As a Ritual.} When you cast this spell as a ritual, its casting time is increased to 6 days. When you cast the spell in this manner, you always roll a natural 20 on the spell’s {@dice d20} roll on an “atypical” casting."
